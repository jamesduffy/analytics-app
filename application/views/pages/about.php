                I wanted a way to find great content on App.net. I know you wanted it too. This is what I came up with Analytics-App at the third ADN Hackathon. We will find the best content and share it with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                There are a lot of plans I have for the future and new ways to find and share the best stuff around the App.net network with you.

                With App.net's recent <a href="http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank">State of the Union</a> post I have decided to keep running Analytics-App for the next few months. I do not make much money from Analytics-App and MMMercury. All of the money goes directly into running my server. I have enough cash from the incentive program and donations for another 3 months.
                </p>

                <p>
                I believe in App.net as a platform and hope that it will continue to grow, but without the incentive program I can not afford the server costs long term. In the coming weeks I will be making changes to Analytics-App and removing a lot of historical data and refocus on holding only the most current posts and interactions.
