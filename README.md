analytics-app
=============

Analytics website for App.net. It keeps track of top posts and most followed for the entire network and personal accounts. It also keeps historical data for each day. Near the end of the project I took over MMMercury and started posting popular content as it happened.

After App.net effectively shut down the developer incentive program I was unable to afford the upkeep of the server and shut the website down.

I used CodeIgniter and MySQL as well as other open source packages. 

This was my first website that was used by a large number of regular users and had a large database.
